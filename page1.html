			<p id="zaki">First off, I want to thank our advertisers, who allow us to create and expand our platform to new levels. Without them, we would be nothing. I want to thank Pugli, Zackee, and Mr. Hryce Bulett. Even though we started operations in 2006 on the wrong foot, we at FA$TCA$H Inc. always wanted to assist the people in meeting their financial goals. Whether it's through siphoning their data to offshore data centers who pay us millions of dollars from advertisers who block the content that you are reading, we help you realize one of they key ways to become a trillionaire is desparation and a negative bank balance. You may be wondering how we suceeded at the expense of the consumer. In our defense, as the air hostesses say prior to a flight, "in the event of a loss of cabin air pressure, please wear your oxygen mask before helping others." Now that we have fastened our oxygen mask, we are ready to put yours on. Finally, our innovative slogans such as "Think Different" and "Just Do It" have been monumental to our growth and our marketing team did a great job coming up with these unique slogans.<br><br></p>
